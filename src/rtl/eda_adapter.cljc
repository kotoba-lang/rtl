(ns rtl.eda-adapter
  "Adapts rtl.synthesis's gate-level netlist into
  kotoba.eda.core/analyze-timing's node/edge timing-graph job shape,
  closing the RTL synthesis -> static-timing-analysis signoff loop.

  Connectivity finding (read rtl.synthesis in full before designing this
  adapter -- see rtl/src/rtl/synthesis.cljc): a `rtl.synthesis/gate` DOES
  carry real connectivity -- `{:gate-type t :inputs [net-name ...]
  :output net-name}` -- and a `rtl.synthesis/gate-netlist`'s
  :primary-inputs/:primary-outputs are net names drawn from the same
  namespace. So this adapter builds a REAL per-gate delay-annotated
  timing graph from the netlist's actual net-name connectivity -- every
  :eda.timing/edges entry below is a genuine (driver-input net ->
  gate-output net) connection read straight from a gate's
  :inputs/:output, NOT a fabricated graph and NOT a serial
  worst-case-chain approximation (that fallback was only needed if
  gate-netlist turned out to be a flat, connectivity-free bag of gates;
  it isn't).

  Delay model: rtl.synthesis carries no physical delay data (no
  liberty/LEF timing arcs) -- that would come from a later
  org-synopsys-liberty / org-si2-lef integration, out of scope here.
  Instead this adapter uses a flat per-gate-type constant
  (`default-delay-model`, nanoseconds) as a documented stand-in, not a
  claim of real cell timing.

  Sequential (:dff) boundary: rtl.synthesis/estimate-depth already
  establishes this repo's own convention for :dff gates -- `depth-of`
  hardcodes a DFF's depth at 0 regardless of its data input, i.e. a
  register launches a fresh combinational stage every clock edge rather
  than combinationally forwarding its D input's arrival time into Q
  within the same period. This adapter mirrors that convention: a DFF's
  Q net gets a single clock-launch edge (delay = the :dff entry in the
  delay model, modelling clock-to-Q delay) instead of an edge from its D
  input, and the DFF's D input net is added to :eda.timing/endpoints (a
  register's data input must settle within the clock period -- the
  classic STA setup-check endpoint) alongside the netlist's
  :primary-outputs. This is a single-cycle, single-clock-domain
  approximation -- it does not unroll multi-cycle register-to-register
  paths -- consistent with analyze-timing's single
  :eda.timing/clock-period-ns input and with rtl.synthesis/stats' own
  naive per-stage max-frequency estimate.

  Same alpha/prototype-grade maturity level as kotoba.eda.core -- see
  eda/README.md's coverage table."

  from the netlist -- it is a modelling anchor for register clock-to-Q

  Combinational gates (anything but :dff) get one edge per input net,
  from that input net to the gate's output net -- a real edge read
  straight from the gate's own :inputs/:output, not fabricated. Because
  analyze-timing computes a node's arrival as
  `max(over incoming edges)(arrival(from) + delay-ns)`, and every edge
  generated for a given gate instance carries that gate's single delay,
  this correctly reduces to
  `arrival(output) = max(arrival(inputs)) + gate-delay`
  for multi-input gates -- exactly the desired combinational semantics,
  with no special-casing needed for gate arity.

  :dff gates instead get exactly one edge, from the synthetic
  `clock-launch` node (arrival 0) to the gate's output net, using the
  :dff entry of `delay-model` as a clock-to-Q constant -- see the
  namespace docstring's sequential-boundary note for why a DFF's D
  input does NOT get a combinational edge into its Q output here."
