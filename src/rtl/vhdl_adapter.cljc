(ns rtl.vhdl-adapter
  "Adapts org-ieee-vhdl's entity/architecture model into rtl.hdl's
  module/port shape, so VHDL sources can drive the same
  synthesis/simulation/eda-timing pipeline that `rtl.hdl/parse-verilog`
  drives for Verilog — one shared `rtl-module`/`rtl-port` representation
  regardless of which HDL frontend produced it.

  Direction vocabulary: `rtl.hdl/port-directions` is a 3-way scheme
  (`#{:input :output :inout}`), but VHDL entity ports have 4 modes
  (`:in`/`:out`/`:inout`/`:buffer`, see `vhdl.entity`). `:in`/`:out`/
  `:inout` map 1:1 to `:input`/`:output`/`:inout`. `:buffer` has no rtl.hdl
  counterpart, so it collapses to `:output` — see
  `vhdl-mode->rtl-direction`'s docstring for why `:output` (not `:inout`)
  is the correct collapse.

  Width: VHDL types carry their width in the type string itself
  (`vhdl.entity/bus-width`, e.g. \"std_logic_vector(7 downto 0)\" -> 8);
  `bus-width` already treats any type string without a `(hi downto/to lo)`
  range — `std_logic`, `boolean`, `integer`, etc. — as scalar width 1, so
  no extra scalar fallback is needed here beyond calling it directly (see
  `vhdl-entity->rtl-module`).

  Signal type: VHDL's entity model carries no wire/reg/logic distinction
  (that's a Verilog net-vs-variable concept). Every converted port is
  tagged `:signal-type :logic`, matching `rtl.hdl/signal-types`' `:logic`
  member and `rtl.simulator`'s four-valued IEEE 1164 logic — the same
  logic system VHDL's own `std_logic` type is named after."

  the direction keyword `rtl.hdl/rtl-port` expects (a member of

  `:in` -> `:input`, `:out` -> `:output`, `:inout` -> `:inout` map
  directly. `:buffer` -> `:output`: a VHDL `buffer` port is still
  single-driver — driven only by this entity, exactly like `:out` — the
  only thing that distinguishes it from `:out` is that the architecture
  body may read back the value it drives (a pre-VHDL-2008 workaround for
  `:out` ports not being readable internally). That readback is an
  internal-visibility detail with no bearing on the port's external
  (synthesis-pin) direction, so it collapses to `:output` rather than
  `:inout` — `:inout` is reserved for genuinely bidirectional/
  multi-driver ports, which `buffer` is not."

  Each port's `:mode` is translated via `vhdl-mode->rtl-direction` and
  its `:type` string via `vhdl.entity/bus-width` for `:width` (`bus-width`
  itself already returns 1 for scalar type strings that carry no
  `(hi downto/to lo)` range — `std_logic`, `boolean`, `integer`, etc. —
  so calling it directly is correct and no separate scalar-width fallback
  is needed). Every port is tagged `:signal-type :logic` (see namespace
  docstring). The module carries no parameters/instances/always-blocks/
  assigns yet — entity ports are all this adapter derives from a VHDL
  entity declaration; architecture body statements are out of scope for
  this conversion (see `architecture->process-count` for the one piece
  of architecture-derived info this namespace does expose)."

  — the same success/error tuple shape as `rtl.hdl/parse-verilog`, so
  callers (synthesis, simulation, eda-timing) can drive either HDL
  frontend uniformly without branching on which one produced the module.

  Unlike `parse-verilog` (which, given its minimal header-only Verilog
  parser, can only return a bare `[name port-names]` pair), the VHDL
  parser already yields each port's mode and type, so this adapter's `:ok`
  payload is the fully-formed `rtl-module` map rather than a name/ports
  pair — the richer payload both frontends' callers can converge on.

  `[:error msg]` cases, mirroring `parse-verilog`'s own checks (missing
  keyword / missing closing keyword):
  - no entity declaration found (`vhdl.parser/parse-entity` leaves `:name`
    nil when no `entity <name> is` line matches)
